# Microchip Software vs Hardware Qt Graphical View Item

This demo is an interactive, multitouch Qt application that uses [libplanes](https://github.com/linux4sam/libplanes) to draw one of the Qt Graphical View items.  Another is done in pure Qt, which means pure software.  A CPU indicator shows CPU usage while manipulating (moving, resizing) one of the items.
